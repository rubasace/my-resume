#    TODO standardize
    location: London, UK (Remote)
    startDate: Feb 2017

    highlights:
      - Helped two small Java teams develop and maintain 200+ microservices by designing and building a corporate Java framework, extending Spring Boot capabilities and providing many cross-cutting concerns out-of-the-box.
      - Removed all Java applications dependency vulnerabilities and reduced zero-days MTTR to hours (since the third-party fixes are provided) by designing a workflow to automatically keep dependencies up to date, combining Renovate bot and Snyk.
      - Improved Java teams velocity and stack reliability by standardizing the CI/CD process, providing base Docker images to transparently adopt JIB/Buildpacks, offering sensible, easily customizable defaults for JVM flags and allowing graceful shutdown of services, among others.
      - Reduced the infrastructure cost in a 5% (~7K€/month) by revisiting logging volume and Kubernetes cluster resource utilization, as a part-time member of the Systems Engineering team.
